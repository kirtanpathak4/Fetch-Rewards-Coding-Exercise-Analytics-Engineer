
1) When considering average spend from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?

SELECT 
    rewardsReceiptStatus, 
    AVG(CAST(totalSpent AS REAL)) AS average_spend
FROM receipts
WHERE rewardsReceiptStatus IN ('FINISHED', 'REJECTED')
GROUP BY rewardsReceiptStatus
ORDER BY average_spend DESC;



2) When considering total number of items purchased from receipts with 'rewardsReceiptStatus’ of ‘Accepted’ or ‘Rejected’, which is greater?


SELECT

3) What are the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for most recent month?


SELECT

JOIN receipt_items AS ri ON r._id = ri.receipt_id
JOIN brands AS b ON ri.barcode = b.barcode
GROUP BY
    brand_name
ORDER BY
    receipt_count DESC
LIMIT 5;



4)How does the ranking of the top 5 brands by receipts scanned for the recent month compare to the ranking for the previous month?
